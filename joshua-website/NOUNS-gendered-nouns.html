<h1>GENDERED NOUNS</h1>

<article>
	<p>Nouns answer the questions <b>"What is it?"</b> and <b>"Who is it?"</b> They give names to things, people, and places.</p>
	<br>
	<div>
		<h4>EXAMPLES:</h4>
		   <ul>
		   	  <li>dog</li>
		   	  <li>bicycle</li>
		   	  <li>Mary</li>
		   	  <li>girl</li>
		   	  <li>beauty</li>
		   	  <li>France</li>
		   	  <li>world</li>
		   </ul>
	</div>
<br>
<p>In general there is no distinction between masculine, feminine in English nouns. However, gender is sometimes shown by different forms or different words when referring to people or animals.</p>
<br>

	<div>
		<h4>EXAMPLES:</h4>
		<table>
		   <tr class="underline">
              <td><b>Masculine</b></td>
              <td><b>Feminine</b></td>
              <td><b>Gender neutral</b></td>
		   </tr>
		   <tr>
              <td>man</td>
              <td>woman</td>
              <td>person</td>

              <td>aunt</td>
              <td></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>

            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>waiter</td>

              <td>hen</td>
              <td>chicken</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>stallion</td>
              <td>mare</td>

<br>
<p>Many nouns that refer to people's roles and jobs can be used for either a masculine or a feminine subject, like for example cousin, teenager, teacher, doctor, student, friend, colleague.</p>
<br>
	<div>
		<h4>EXAMPLES:</h4>
		   <ul>
		   	  <li>Mary is my friend. She is a doctor.</li>
		   	  <li>Peter is my cousin. He is a doctor.</li>
		   	  <li>Arthur is my friend. He is a student.</li>
		   	  <li>Jane is my cousin. She is a student.</li>
		   </ul>
	</div>
<br>
<p>It is possible to make the distinction for these neutral words by adding the words male or female.</p>
<br>
	<div>
		<h4>EXAMPLES:</h4>
		   <ul>
		   	  <li>Sam is a female doctor.</li>
		   	  <li>No, he is not my boyfriend, he is just a male friend.</li>
		   	  <li>I have three female cousins and two male cousins.</li>
		   </ul>
	</div>
<br>
<p>Infrequently, nouns describing things without a gender are referred to with a gendered pronoun to show familiarity. It is also correct to use the gender-neutral pronoun (it).</p>
<br>
	<div>
		<h4>EXAMPLES:</h4>
		   <ul>
		   	  <li>I love my car. She (the car) is my greatest passion.</li>
		   	  <li>France is popular with her (France's) neighbours at the moment.</li>
		   	  <li>I travelled from England to New York on the Queen Elizabeth; <b>she</b> (the Queen Elizabeth) is a great ship.</li>
		   </ul>
