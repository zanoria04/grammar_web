<h1>Definite pronouns</h1>

<article>
	<p>Pronouns replace nouns. A different pronoun is required depending on two elements: the noun being replaced and the function that noun has in the sentence. In English, pronouns only take the gender of the noun they replace in the 3rd person singular form. The 2nd person plural pronouns are identical to the 2nd person singular pronouns except for the reflexive pronoun.</p>

<h3>SUBJECT PRONOUNS</h3>
<p>Subject pronouns replace nouns that are the subject of their clause. In the 3rd person, subject pronouns are often used to avoid repetition of the subject's name.</p>
<br>
<div>
	<p><strong>EXAMPLES:</strong></p>
	   <ul>
	 	  <li><b>I</b> am 16.</li>
	   	  <li><b>You</b> seem lost.</li>
	   	  <li>Jim is angry, and <b>he</b> wants Sally to apologize.</li>
	   	  <li>This table is old. <b>It</b> needs to be repainted.</li>
		  <li><b>We</b> aren't coming.</li>
	   	  <li><b>They</b> don't like pancakes.</li>
	   </ul>
	</div>
<br>
<h3>OBJECT PRONOUNS</h3>
<p>Object pronouns are used to replace nouns that are the direct or indirect object of a clause.</p>
<br>
<div>
	<p><strong>EXAMPLES:</strong></p>
	   <ul>
	 	  <li>Give the book to <b>me</b>.</li>
	   	  <li>The teacher wants to talk to <b>you</b>.</li>
	   	  <li>Jake is hurt because Bill hit <b>him</b>.</li>
	   	  <li>Rachid recieved a letter from <b>her</b> last week.</li>
		  <li>Mark can't find <b>it</b>.</li>
	   	  <li>Don't be angry with <b>us</b>.</li>
	   	  <li>Tell <b>them</b> to hurry up!</li>
	   </ul>
	</div>
<br>
<h3>POSSESSIVE ADJECTIVES (DETERMINERS)</h3>
<p>Possessive adjectives are not pronouns, but rather determiners. It is useful to learn them at the same time as pronouns, however, because they are similar in form to the possessive pronouns. Possessive adjectives function as adjectives, so they appear before the noun they modify. They do not replace a noun as pronouns do.</p>
<br>
<div>
	<p><strong>EXAMPLES:</strong></p>
	   <ul>
	 	  <li>Did mother find <b>my shoes</b>?</li>
	   	  <li>Mrs. Baker wants to see <b>your homework</b>.</li>
	   	  <li>Can Jake bring over <b>his baseball cards</b>?</li>
	   	  <li>Samantha will fix <b>her bike</b> tomorrow.</li>
		  <li>The cat broke <b>its leg</b>.</li>
	   	  <li>This is <b>our house</b>.</li>
	   	  <li>Where is <b>their school</b>?</li>
	   </ul>
	</div>
<br>
<h3>POSSESSIVE PRONOUNS</h3>
<p>Possessive pronouns replace possessive nouns as either the subject or the object of a clause. Because the noun being replaced doesn't appear in the sentence, it must be clear from the context.</p>
<br>
<div>
	<p><strong>EXAMPLES:</strong></p>
	   <ul>
	 	  <li>This bag is <b>mine</b>.</li>
	   	  <li><b>Yours</b> is not blue.</li>
	   	  <li>That bag looks like <b>his</b>.</li>
	   	  <li>These shoes are not <b>hers</b>.</li>
		  <li>That car is <b>ours</b>.</li>
	   	  <li><b>Theirs</b> is parked in the garage.</li>
	   </ul>
	</div>
<br>
<h3>REFLEXIVE & INTENSIVE PRONOUNS</h3>
<p>Reflexive and intensive pronouns are the same set of words but they have different functions in a sentence.</p>
<br>
<p>Reflexive pronouns refer back to the subject of the clause because the subject of the action is also the direct or indirect object. Only certain types of verbs can be reflexive. You cannot remove a reflexive pronoun from a sentence because the remaining sentence would be grammatically incorrect.</p>
<br>
<div>
	<p><strong>EXAMPLES:</strong></p>
	   <ul>
	 	  <li>I told <b>myself</b> to calm down.</li>
	   	  <li>You cut <b>yourself</b> on this nail?</li>
	   	  <li>He hurt <b>himself</b> on the stairs.</li>
	   	  <li>She found <b>herself</b> in a dangerous part of town.</li>
		  <li>The cat threw <b>itself</b> under my car!</li>
	   	  <li>We blame <b>ourselves</b> for the fire.</li>
	   	  <li>The children can take care of <b>themselves</b>.</li>
	   </ul>
	</div>
<br>
<p>Intensive pronouns emphasize the subject of a clause. They are not the object of the action. The intensive pronoun can always be removed from a sentence without changing the meaning significantly, although the emphasis on the subject will be removed. Intensive pronouns can be placed immediately after the subject of the clause, or at the end of the clause.</p>
<br>
	<div>
	<p><strong>EXAMPLES:</strong></p>
	   <ul>
	 	  <li>I made these cookies <b>myself</b>.</li>
	   	  <li>You <b>yourself</b> asked Jake to come.</li>
	   	  <li>The Pope <b>himself</b> pardoned Mr. Brown.</li>
	   	  <li>My teacher didn't know the answer <b>herself</b>.</li>
		  <li>The test <b>itself</b> wasn't scary, but my teacher certainly is.</li>
	   	  <li>We would like to finish the renovation before Christmas <b>ourselves</b>.</li>
	   	  <li>They <b>themselves</b> told me the lost shoe wasn't a problem.</li>
	   </ul>
